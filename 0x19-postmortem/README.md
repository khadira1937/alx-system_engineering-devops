# Postmortem: Unexpected Downtime on Authentication Service

## Issue Summary:

**Duration:**
- Start Time: November 8, 2023, 18:45 (UTC)
- End Time: November 8, 2023, 19:30 (UTC)

**Impact:**
The authentication service experienced unexpected downtime, leading to connection errors for users. Approximately 15% of users were affected during the outage. The core authentication service on the Django framework was unavailable, resulting in failed login attempts and user authentication issues.

**Root Cause:**
The absence of proper environment variable configurations prevented the Django application from authenticating users, leading to service downtime.

## Timeline:

**Detection:**
The issue was detected on November 8, 2023, 18:45 (UTC) through automated monitoring alerts indicating a spike in failed authentication attempts.

**Actions Taken:**
- Investigated server logs for any unusual activity or errors related to authentication processes.
- Assumed the issue might be related to recent code changes in the authentication module.

**Misleading Paths:**
Initially explored database connections, suspecting issues with query performance affecting authentication. Checked for recent code changes and deployment logs.

**Escalation:**
The incident was escalated to the Development team after initial investigation suggested a potential code-related issue.

## Resolution:

Rolled back to the previous stable version of the authentication service, restoring proper environment variable configurations. Restarted the necessary services to apply the rollback.

## Root Cause and Resolution:

**Root Cause:**
The absence of proper environment variable configurations in the recent deployment caused the Django application to fail during the authentication process.

**Resolution:**
- Rolled back to the previous version, ensuring the correct environment variable settings were in place.
- Implemented additional checks in the deployment process to verify environment variable configurations.

## Corrective and Preventative Measures:

**Improvements/Fixes:**
- Enhance automated testing procedures to include specific tests for environment variable configurations.
- Strengthen monitoring for authentication-related errors and failed login attempts.
- Implement a checklist in the deployment process to validate and confirm the correctness of environment variables.

**Tasks:**
- Conduct a thorough review of the authentication service's environment variable setup to identify and rectify potential misconfigurations.
- Schedule regular audits of authentication logs to proactively identify and address potential issues.
- Implement a post-deployment validation step to verify the stability of the authentication service after each release.

*In conclusion, the unexpected downtime in the authentication service was promptly addressed by rolling back to a stable version and implementing additional testing measures. This incident highlights the critical role of proper environment variable configurations and underscores the need for vigilant monitoring and testing in the deployment process. The outlined corrective and preventative measures aim to enhance the resilience of the authentication service, ensuring a more dependable user authentication experience.*
